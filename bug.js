```javascript
// Example showing a Tailwind CSS error where a class is not applied correctly due to a typo or incorrect selector.
<div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 text-white">
  This div should have a blue background, but doesn't.
</div>

// In this case, the error is a typo in the class name: `bg-blue-500` is correct, not `bg-blue-5000`.
// Another common error: forgetting to import or include Tailwind directives in your project.
